\section*{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Minutes from the previous meeting were read and approved.

\item Matters arising out of minutes.
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{2.1}: Handbook was read by eveyone.
      \item \textbf{2.2}:
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Matthew took the embedded device home to practice the first couple of labs.
         \item Luca was assigned to read further the ARM documentation regarding the microcontroller.
         \item Graham was exempt due to personal obligations.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{2.3}: Embedded device was picked up and given to Matthew.
      \item \textbf{2.4}: Messenger chat was created to facilitate communication.
      \item \textbf{2.5}: Wednesday was designated to be the primary meeting slot.
      \item \textbf{2.6}: Everyone succesffuly installed all technologies on their machines.
      \item \textbf{2.7}: Eveyone succesffuly flashed lab 1 program to embedded device.
   \end{enumerate}

\item Information was shared between memebers.
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Matthew described how he managed to print "Hello World!" to the screen.
   \item Luca described the process of how the microcontroller handles the registers and functions.
   \end{enumerate}

\item Discussion and research on possible designs for DTMF.
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Discussion on the way in which the DTMF is defined from Wikipedia.
      \item Discussion was done for how we would split the incoming signal after it has been read from the ADC.
      \item Discussion on what could occur after signal is processed (Error and Success) ex. Print to LCD or light LED.
   \end{enumerate}
   
\item The challenges regarding how to handle the different components mentioned in the requirments  where discussed but no concensus was reached.

\item Simple beginning draft was proposed and written in the design brief.

\item Other matters
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Discussion on how to write and explain what we will do to tackle the requirments from the specificaton in the design brief.
   \item Discussion on the ADC as Luca was unclear of how to properly handle the conversion and storage of data.
   \item No concensus reached as matter will have to be repeated to Graham and Julian.
   \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Actions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Reading information on the how to merge the individual parts into one whole system. Meaning how to connect the reading of data from ADC, to then the decoder, and then print some response to user.
\begin{flushright}
Assigned to: \textbf{Everyone} \\
Deadline: \textbf{Next Meeting}
\end{flushright}

\item New meeting time, due to being behind in writing the design brief, scheduled for next Thursday.
\begin{flushright}
Assigned to: \textbf{Everyone} \\
Deadline: \textbf{Thursday 07/03/24}
\end{flushright}

\end{enumerate}
