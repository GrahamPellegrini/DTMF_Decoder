\abstract{%
   Write an executive summary for your project. This should not overflow into
   the next page, should not contain references, and should be readable by
   a wide audience.
   }

\section{Introduction}
Write an introduction, explaining the purpose and background of this project.
Give a brief description of the game to be implemented.
References to be cited like so \cite{stroustrup2000}.
Also include an overview of this document.

\section{System Design}
Make sure to mention the process that will be done on each individual sample "block",
where you talk about after what amount of time will you handle proccessing and what is the processing of a block.

ADC will collect only one sample, make sure to tell the ADC to sample after a given period using something like a interrupt from a timer.

In general the sample of a signal will be twice or more the frequeny.

Talk about how you will handle the system in real time.
Mentioning how to you have to seperate a thread to handle the saving and getting of the data from the ADC ( Analog digital converter ), and a "concurrent" thread to handle the processing of an already in store memory block.

We may include images in the system design the explain the workflow and data flow and control flow of the system.

\section{Management}
Include a time plan.
Show task dependencies.
How are these going to be managed?
