\section*{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Minutes from the previous meeting were read and approved.

   \item Matters arising out of minutes
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{7.1}:
                  The ADC sampling task was finalised and the code works currently ( before attaching the decoding algorithm ).
                  The circuit and the microcontroller communicate and the values are read between $0$ and $VREF$.
            \item \textbf{7.2}:
                  Work was put in place to start writing the decoding the algorithm in C.
                  Graham started writing utility functions, and functions that handled mapping the frequency pairs to numbers and letters.
            \item \textbf{7.3}:
                  Discussion and ideas where shared on how to improve the design brief for these current parts.
                  No final descision was reached.
         \end{enumerate}

   \item Progress report from group members
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item Matthew Mifsud described his implementation for the ADC sampling interface.
            \item Luca Vella described the Python notebook detailing the Goertzel algorithm along with Julian Falzon describing the advantages of using Goertzel over implementing a standard FFT for this project.
            \item Graham Pellegrini assisted Matthew with work on display functions.
         \end{enumerate}

   \item Matthew Mifsud proposed taking the board home to continue experimenting with the display.

   \item Other matters
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item No other matters
         \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
