    "#EEPROM device description\n",
    "#EEPROM is a non-volatile memory mainly used for storing relatively small amounts of data, for example for storing settings. There are three operations for accessing the memory: reading, writing and erase/program. \"Writing\" to memory is split up into two separate operations, writing and erase/program. The first operation, which will be called \"writing\" in this document, is not really updating the memory, but only updating the temporary data register called the \"page register\". The page register needs to be written with a minimum 1 byte and a maximum 64 bytes before the second operation, which is called \"erase/program\" in this document, can be used to actually update the non-volatile memory. Note that the data written to the page register is not \"cached\"; it cannot be read before it is actually programmed into non-volatile memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The 64-byte page register is the same size as a page in EEPROM memory. The 4,032 bytes EEPROM on most devices contains 63 pages. Devices with a 2 kB EEPROM provide 2,048 bytes on 32 pages.37.4.2 EEPROM operations. An EEPROM device cannot be programmed directly. Writing data to it and the actual erase/program of the memory are two separate steps. The page register (64 bytes) will temporarily hold write data. But as soon as this data needs to be read from the EEPROM or data needs to be written to another page, the contents of the page register first needs to be programmed into the EEPROM memory. The following sections explain the EEPROM operations (read, write and erase/program) in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#37.4.2.1 Writing: The EEPROM controller supports writing of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit elements. Since the EEPROM device doesn’t directly support 32-bit write operations, the controller splits the operation into two 16-bit operations.For doing a write operation first an address needs to be written into the address register and the kind of write operation needs to be selected in the command register. This can be done in any order. After this the data is written to the write data register, which automatically starts the write operation on the EEPROM device.

    "\n",
    "#Chapter 37: LPC408x/407x EEPROM memory - A write operation causes an automatic post-increment of the address. This allows consecutive writes to the page register without the need of writing a new address for every write operation. Of course the address register could be written with another address value to write to another location. If the data register is written while a previous EEPROM operation is still pending, the write transfer on the system bus is stalled until the previous operation is finished. This can be avoided by polling the interrupt status register to see if an operation is still pending before starting the write operation. Software has to make sure that the following rules are followed: • overwriting (writing it two times before an erase/program operation) one of the locations in a 64-byte page register is not allowed. It will cause the loss of the previously written data \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Chapter 37: LPC408x/407x EEPROM memory - • in case the default address post-incrementing is used, the upper boundary of the page register may not be crossed • the contents of the page register needs to be programmed into non-volatile memory before it can be read back • write operations to a misaligned address will result in an error response on the write transfer to the write data register (for example a 32-bit write operation to an address other than a multiple of 0x4). The operation will not be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#37.4.2.2 Erase/Programming - After the page register has been written with user data, it still has to programmed into non-volatile memory. This is a separate step. Only writing to the page register will not write the EEPROM memory. Programming the page into memory takes a relatively long time, therefore the corresponding interrupt can be enabled, or the interrupt status bit can be polled to avoid stalling of the system bus. An erase/program operation starts by providing the MSBs of the address that selects the page in memory. The 6 LSBs are \"don’t care\". The operation is started by writing the command register (selecting the erase/program operation). Before beginning a programming operation, the EEPROM status should be polled to insure that the last write operation has been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#37.4.2.3 Reading - The EEPROM controller supports reading 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit elements. Since the EEPROM device doesn’t support 32-bit operations the controller splits the operation into two 16-bit operations. For doing a read operation, an address first needs to be written into the address register. Then the operation needs to be selected in the command register. Writing the command register will automatically start the read operation on the EEPROM device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Chapter 37: LPC408x/407x EEPROM memory - If the read data register is read while the read operation is still pending, then the read transfer on the system bus is stalled until the previous read operation is finished. This can be avoided by polling the interrupt status register to see if the operation is still pending before reading the read data register. Read operations will automatically post-increment the address register. This allows consecutive reads from the EEPROM memory without the need of writing a new address for every read operation. By setting the read data prefetch bit in the command register, reading from the read data register automatically starts up a read operation from the next (incremented) address location. When doing consecutive reads in this way, the first read operation is started as result of writing the command register. The following read operations are started as result of reading the read data register to obtain the result of the previous read operations.Read operations from a misaligned address will result on an error response on the write transfer to the command register (for example a 32-bit read operation from an address other than a multiple of 0x4). The operation will not be performed.\n",
